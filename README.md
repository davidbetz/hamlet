Even then, you don't just need sample text, you need some type of rich sample data. This project gives you both string and object generators.

Here's a string sample:

Beowulf sample:

Here's a MongoDB (similar to JSON) sample:

            "senseless grapple"
        ],

You can use the various scripts here to mass-generate data for a variety of systems (e.g. Node.js, MongoDB, etc...)
